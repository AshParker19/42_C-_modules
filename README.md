## C++ Modules

At 42, we maintain the idea of learning the basics of the language and then moving on to the more modern standards. This is why we study C++ of the 98 standard.
Our background in C helps us pick up the basics of C++ faster. The main difference is that C++ is object-oriented. Thanks to the 42 learning model, we don't get overwhelmed by new concepts. We begin with the basics and then tackle more complex topics.

This repository contains 10 modules of C++ piscine at 42. Each module is dedicated to a specific topic and contains a set of exercises and a README.md file which contains a description of the exercises and a list of concepts that we learn in the module. Also there is a knowledge section where I collect some useful information about the topic.
