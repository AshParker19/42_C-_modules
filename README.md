## C++ Modules

The idea is to learn the basics of the language and then move on to the more modern standards, this why at 42 we study C++ of 98 standard.

This repository contains modules of C++ piscine at 42. Each module is dedicated to a specific topic.
There are 10 modules in total. Each module contains a set of exercises and a README.md file which contains a description of the exercises and a list of concepts that we learn in the module.
