## C++ module01

> This module intoduces us to some new concepts in C++.

### Concepts
* memory allocation
* references
* pointers to members
* accepting const references in functions and constructors
* arrays of objects
* file handling and streams
* initialization lists
* static class members
* const class members
* class function pointers
* switch statements

### ex00
In this exercise we learn how to allocate memory in C++ using "new" and "delete" keywords. We discowered how to use "references" and "pointers to members". 

### ex01
In this exercise we allocated memory for an array of objects. We tried to work with each of the array elements

### ex02
We demystified references in this exercise, we compared them to pointers and learned how to use them.

### ex03
This exercise was about were about objects accepting a references and pointers to other objects. We also checked out how to sent assign an object trough a constructor and though a function.

### ex04
In this exercise we learned how to work with files in C++. We learned how to use "ifstream" and "ofstream" classes. We learned how to use "getline" function.

### ex05
Here we had to figure out how to write a cooresponing message withou using "if" or "switch" statements. We learned how to use "static" and "const" in a class. We learned how to use "class function pointers" and arrays of function pointers.

### ex06
We han an opportunity to work with switch statements in this exercise.
