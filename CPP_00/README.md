## Exercises

### ex00
In this exersice we learn how to use "streams" in C++ as we use "printf" in C. Also we learn how to use "string" class, ans how to call methods of a class.

### ex01
In this exersice we understand the C++ way of working with infinite loops.
We learn how to organize C++ projects, naming files and classes.
We understand the difference between "public" and "private" in a class, and how to use constructors. We're introduced to setters and getters functions.

### ex02
42 provided us with a test file and a header file. We had to write a class that would pass the tests. We learned how to use "const" in a class, and how to use "static" in a class.
This exercise boosted our understanding of classes and how to use them.

## Knowledge

#### Streams
In C++, streams are used to perform input and output operations. They are based on standard input-output streams of C programming language. In C++, input and out streams are class objects that are used to read from and write to files and devices such as the keyboard or printer.

#### Class
A class is a user-defined data type that we can use in our program, and it works as an object constructor, or a "blueprint" for creating objects.

#### Class constructor and destructor
Constructor is a tool which helps us to initialize objects of a class.  It is called constructor because it constructs the values of data members of the class.
Destructor is a tool which helps us to destroy objects of a class.  It is called destructor because it destructs all the memory allocated by constructor.

#### Class attributes
There are 2 types of components of a class:
* Attributes (variables)
* Methods (functions)

#### String class
In C++ a tring is an object of the class "string", not an array of characters as in C. The string class has a lot of useful methods, which we needed to code ourselves in C.
