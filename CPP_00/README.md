## C++ module00

> This module is an introduction to C++ at 42.

### Concepts
* C++ streams
* C++ class
* C++ class constructor and destructor
* C++ class attributes
* C++ class member functions
* C++ class accessors
* C++ string class
* C++ class methods

### ex00
In this exersice we learn how to use "streams" in C++ as we use "printf" in C. Also we learn how to use "string" class, ans how to call methods of a class.

### ex01
In this exersice we understand the C++ way of working with infininite loops.
We learn how to organize C++ projects, naming files and classes.
We understand the difference between "public" and "private" in a class, and how to use constructors. We're introdused to setters and getters fuctions.

### ex02
42 provided us with a test file and a header file. We had to write a class that would pass the tests. We learned how to use "const" in a class, and how to use "static" in a class.
This exercise boosted our understanding of classes and how to use them.
